## Methodology

We define the loss function $L(\theta)$ as follows:

$$
L(\theta) = \sum_{i=1}^{N} (y_i - f(x_i; \theta))^2 + \lambda ||\theta||^2
$$

This converges when $\lambda \to 0$.

As discussed by @knuth84, literate programming is essential.
However, others disagree [@knuth84; @anotherpaper20].
